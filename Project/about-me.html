				I am a college student and I started drawing in my free time during middle school. Over time, once
				I entered high school I was introduced into Japanese manga, bearing obvious similarities to comics
				here in the west, but with a distinct difference in content, targeting late-teenagers with fantasy or
				other action scenarios.<br>
				Eventually people noticed what I was drawing and started asking if I could do drawings of them in
				specific scenarios like fighting dragons or fighting Darth Vader, so once I got out of high school
				I figured it would be fun to continue doing the drawings for people, and this is where I ended up.
